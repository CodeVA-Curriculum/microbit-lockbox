# Display & Lifecycle

Your teacher will use the slide deck below when they facilitate this lesson--feel free to use this copy to access links, etc.

Here are some tutorials to review some basic output options and lifecycle functions that you'll need to use when you write code with the MicroBit:

## Predict, Run, Investigate

To get started, check out the starter code below:

<!-- ::makecode{id='_A68LfXPCX6i4'} -->
![A screenshot of a MakeCode program](/display-primm-image.png)

You can download the starter code or open it in the MakeCode editor by clicking the buttons below:

::download[Download]{file="/examples/microbit-display-prim.hex"}
::button[Open in MakeCode]{href="https://makecode.microbit.org/_A68LfXPCX6i4" style="is-primary"}

Try running and modifying the code below to answer the following questions:

- Predict what you think the program will do based on what you know about the MicroBit and MakeCode.
- What does the code actually cause the MicroBit to do?
- What is the difference between the code in the “on start” block and the code in the “forever” block?
- What is the purpose of the "on start" block? What is the purpose of the "forever" block?

## Make: Unlocking Animation

Make a program that shows the MicroBit “unlocking” using basic output blocks, sound, and/or music output. Then, upload your program to a public place and try importing someone else’s program to try on your device. How will you show that your puzzle box is unlocked for the competition?

Choose one of the prompts below to guide your work, or make up your own goal that you think is interesting, challenging, or unique.
