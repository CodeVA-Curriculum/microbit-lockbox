Here is a tutorial on the basics of "event blocks"--these are the kinds of blocks you'll most often use for coding simple input on the Micro:Bit.

## Predict, Run, Investigate, Debug & Modify

Each of the following tutorials below has examples of how to implement a particular style of input using the Micro:Bit. Choose input strategies you are interested in, and try them out on your Micro:Bit!

::tutorial{slug="button-events"}
::tutorial{slug="pin-events"}
::tutorial{slug="gesture-events"}
::tutorial{slug="sound-events"}

After you've tried implementing some input strategies, move on to the *Make* stage to build a prototype combining multiple inputs!

## Make

First, make a diagram of your 
Lock box with event sensors
Lock box with a hidden sensor
Lock box with one or more sensors made up of multiple parts (think about how you can combine conductors)
