Here is a tutorial on the basics of "event blocks"--these are the kinds of blocks you'll most often use for coding simple input on the Micro:Bit.

## Predict, Run, Investigate, Debug & Modify

Each of the following tutorials below has examples of how to implement a particular style of input using the Micro:Bit. Each tutorial below has some code examples to copy and some modification prompts to get you thinking about how to implement it in your "fidget cube". Choose input strategies you are interested in, and try them out on your Micro:Bit!

After you've tried implementing some input strategies, move on to the *Make* stage to build a prototype combining multiple inputs!

## Make

First, make a diagram of your 
Lock box with event sensors
Lock box with a hidden sensor
Lock box with one or more sensors made up of multiple parts (think about how you can combine conductors)
