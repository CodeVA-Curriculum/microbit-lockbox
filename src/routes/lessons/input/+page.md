# Input with MicroBit

Your teacher will use the slide deck below when they facilitate this lesson--feel free to use this copy to access links, etc.

Here is a tutorial on the basics of "event blocks"--these are the kinds of blocks you'll most often use for coding simple input on the MicroBit.

## Predict, Run, Investigate, Debug & Modify

Each of the following tutorials below has examples of how to implement a particular style of input using the MicroBit. Each tutorial below has some code examples to copy and some modification prompts to get you thinking about how to implement it in your "fidget cube". Choose input strategies you are interested in, and try them out on your MicroBit!
<!-- TODO: PRIM prompts -->

After you've tried implementing some input strategies, move on to the *Make* stage to build a prototype combining multiple inputs!

## Make: "Fidget Cube" Prototype

Create an enclosure for your Micro:Bit that allows a user to interact with sensors (input) to create different kinds of output. Here are some input examples:

- Button presses
- Gestures
- Logo interaction (press, release, hold)
- Sound sensing
- Capacitive pin press/release

...and here are some output examples:

- Music/sound
- LED grid animation
- Scrolling text on display

Later on, you’ll extend this project to turn your “fidget cube” (which just reacts to user input) into a puzzle, where users need to provide specific inputs in a particular order to “unlock” your device.

**Choose from one of the project prompts below**, and then plan out your project before assembling and testing it!

            <td class='has-text-left'>Create an interactive program that causes the Micro:Bit to react visually and/or aurally to two or more kinds of input events; one of these should be “hidden” to the user, requiring exploration.</td>

            <td class='is-narrow' style='background-color: #e3efc8;'>Multipart Input</td>

            <td class='has-text-left'>Create an interactive program that causes the Micro:Bit to react visually and/or aurally to two or more kinds of input events; one of these should require the user to manipulate multiple moving parts on the enclosure of your “fidget cube” to trigger the event.</td>
        <tr>
        <tr class='has-text-centered is-fullwidth'>
            <td class='is-narrow' style='background-color: #e3efc8;'>Make Up Your Own!</td>
            <td class='is-narrow'>❓</td>
            <td class='has-text-left'>Create your own spin on the “fidget cube” idea. Incorporate new blocks, and see if you can create something unique!</td>
        <tr>

To complete the project, follow these steps:

1. Create a plan for your “fidget cube” prototype. Draw, sketch, model, or diagram your enclosure, labeling the inputs and outputs you plan to use.
2. Create the enclosure, including installing the MicroBit in your enclosure and hooking up any sensors you need to use to the Micro:Bit pins.
3. Write the code for your prototype so the Micro:Bit produces a unique output for each input you included in your diagram.

You only need to make one prototype with your partner. Save your group’s second Micro:Bit for future activities. After you’ve finished your prototype, be ready to share it with another group and talk about the inputs you used!
