## Conditionals Basics

Here are some tutorials on the basics of conditional control structures, which allow you to have your Micro:Bit make automated decisions based on the values of variables stored in its memory.

## Conditionals Demonstration

Download the `.hex` file below by clicking the button. Load it onto your Micro:Bit, and press the buttons to start up the program. After 30 seconds, the Micro:Bit will give you some output based on how you interact with the buttons during the 30 seconds.

Consider the following questions after running the program:

- What decision did the computer make?
- What data do you think the computer used in order to make that decision?
- What would you need to know about the input provided to the program in order to predict its output?

## Predict, Run, Investigate

Previously, you created a [fidget cube](/lessons/input) project to prototype your lockbox puzzle. Now, you'll use variables and "if" statements to turn your "fidget cube" into a puzzle box.

Here are some ideas for how you might use conditionals and variables in your lockbox puzzle. Check out the tutorials, and then use the *Project Design Menu* in your handbook to make a plan for how you'll modify your "fidget cube" to turn it into a puzzle box. You will probably want to combine and/or modify the examples below to make your box challenging enough!
